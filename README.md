#### How it Works  
Connect the shield to Jetson Nano and after that connect the device to a battery (power supply) and connect electrodes.
Full galvanic isolation from mains required.  
This also applies to the monitor. Use only a monitor that is powered by the Jetson Nano.  
ADS1299 allow measure 8 biosignals

#### Device pinout  
Shiled connceted with JetsonNano only in the next points   
 
  
#### Description of the code  
For signal processing can be used Python scripts
